> **Project Status**: In Development ⚠️

## 📘 Description
Study and analysis of the main photonic devices in silicon. The goal of this project is to explore the fundamentals of photonic devices and simulate their behavior using **Lumerical** software and its **Python API integration**.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Lumerical**: Simulation software for photonic devices.
- **Python**: For control and automation of simulations via the Lumerical API.
- **Git** and **GitHub**: For code versioning and collaboration.
