'FORCE SYMMETRIC X, Y, Z MESH: This will force a symmetric mesh about the x, y or z axis. When this option is enabled, the meshing algorithm ONLY considers objects in the positive half of the simulation region. The mesh in the negative half is simply a copy of the positive half mesh. All physical structures and mesh override regions in the negative half will not be considered by the meshing algorithm. This option also forces a mesh point at the center of the simulation region. Forcing a symmetric mesh ensures that the mesh does not change when going from a simulation with symmetry to a simulation without symmetry.'

The optimization figure of merit (FOM) was the power in the TE0 mode at either branch. It was 
calculated by the overlap integral of the TE0 mode of a 500 nm x 220 nm waveguide with the 
detected field at the output branch at wavelength 1550 nm. Note that it is not proper to set the 
total detected power to be FOM, since higher order modes will leak out of the waveguide 
along the way. Maximizing the power effectively reduces the scattering and back-reflection (Zhang)
